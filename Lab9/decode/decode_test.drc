WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   uart_print/Mram_state_reg[3]_PWR_84_o_Mux_43_o is sourced by a combinatorial
   pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading
   of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   decode/instruction[15]_Decoder_4_OUT<0> is sourced by a combinatorial pin.
   This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of
   data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net uart_print/tx_enable is
   sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE
   pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   uart_print/state_reg[3]_GND_658_o_Mux_67_o is sourced by a combinatorial pin.
   This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of
